Search Page:
WeatherApp opens with a sleek and intuitive search page. Here, you can effortlessly enter the name of any city or location that piques your curiosity. I've designed the search functionality to be smooth and hassle-free, ensuring you get the weather details you need in an instant.

Detail Page:
Once you've picked a location, WeatherApp's detail page takes you on a weather journey. You'll find a wealth of crucial information, including the current temperature, humidity levels, wind speed, and a succinct yet descriptive overview of the weather conditions. And that's not all â€“ you can also explore forecasts for upcoming days, helping you plan your activities with confidence.

OpenWeatherAPI Magic:
I've seamlessly integrated the powerful OpenWeatherAPI to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data. This integration guarantees that the information you receive is reliable and tailored to the location you're interested in.
